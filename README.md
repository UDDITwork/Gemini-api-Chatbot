# ðŸš€ Building a Chatbot with Gemini API

This concise guide shows you how to quickly build your own interactive chatbot using Gemini API. Begin by setting up a Flask backend where you'll integrate the Gemini API key securely. Install required Python libraries including Flask and google-generativeai (`pip install flask requests`). Develop API endpoints that handle incoming user queries, pass them to the Gemini model, and relay the generated responses back to the frontend. Use HTML/CSS or React.js to create a responsive chat interface where users can send messages and view AI-driven replies in real-time. Enhance user experience by managing errors effectively and providing intuitive interactions. ðŸŽ¯
